# Date: January 29

Our group finalised the project idea over the week and we begun to work on the project proposal. The main agenda was to come up with a comprehensive block diagram
We identified three main subsystems: RFID, Breathalyzer, and Data management. We shared multiple ideas to discuss feasibility, and evaluate pros and cons.
We all brought our different ideas, potential pairs of problems an solutions to the table and collaborated effectively to ensure each subsystem complemented the others and functioned well in the overall system. We made sure everyone understood their responsibilities and their duties towards each other. Our collaborative efforts resulted in a cohesive and effective system design that met the requirements of the project proposal.
