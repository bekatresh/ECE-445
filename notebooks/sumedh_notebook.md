Our group has finalized the project idea over the course of the week and we began to work on the project proposal. Our primary objective was to develop a comprehensive block diagram. We identified three main subsystems: RFID, Breathalyzer, and Data Management. We shared multiple ideas to discuss their feasibility, and evaluated their pros and cons. Each team member brought their unique ideas, potential problem-solution pairs to the table, and collaborated effectively to ensure that each subsystem complemented the others and functioned well in the overall system. We made sure everyone understood their responsibilities and duties towards each other. By the end of it, we had a skeletal structure and a somewhat finished block diagram.

We delved further into the problem and tried to identify more issues and ideas on how to tackle them. Essentially, we thought more about expanding on the implementation of our subsystems and laid out an initial game plan, including the parts we would need and how the product we are delivering would be used in practice. We discussed the project idea on a more user-friendly level. The project would include RFID-enabled wristbands/cards, a breathalyzer, a Raspberry Pi, and a microcontroller to measure the blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of users and encourage more responsible drinking.

The TipsyTracker system would remind users to get their BAC levels checked so they can be in control of their senses on a real scale analysis. The system would alert the host if a guest's BAC levels are above a certain threshold. I carried forth discussions about the real-time use cases and issues about device liquid safety, and anticipating the problems for the device in real-time such as what would we have the device do in case of system failure, and what could cause our project to either malfunction or provide mismanaged data. Privacy is also a concern that we would have to tackle since we would be handling so much data about BAC levels.

We finalized the proposal and made small edits to it in accordance with the formatting of previous semesters. I assisted with finishing up the block diagram and made the high-level requirements more suitable to the overall success of our project instead of depending on the subsystem workings. We made plans of getting final inputs from the TA and making a submission for the project proposal a day before the deadline.

We had made plans to breadboard the ordered components and were able to successfully breadboard the complete system design. This step was imperative to test the functionality of the various subsystems and identify any potential issues that needed to be resolved before proceeding with the manufacturing process. Akash made the decision to take the lead on making the PCB schematics with the incorporated parts.

Additionally, breadboarding the entire system helped the team to verify that all the components were correctly interconnected and that the system was working according to the expected standards. By utilizing the expertise of each team member, any problems encountered during testing were effectively addressed to ensure that the system operated as intended.

We decided to work on the design document and laid out a plan on how we would use the proposal as a basis and expand on the requirements and verification of the subsystems. In the course of the discussion, we carefully reviewed the current system design, identified areas that required clarification or more development, and discussed the implementation plan. Moreover, we identified potential issues that could arise during the manufacturing process. This comprehensive review

We conducted a successful design review presentation where my teammates and I went over our design document with the professors and some TAs. We received valuable feedback about a possible problem where our device could be provided with fake BAC values for a user when the air they blow into the breathalyzer is not generated with enough pressure so that it comes from the lungs. To tackle this issue, the professor suggested the addition of a pressure sensor, and we decided to go over the feasibility of this addition with the TA.

We reviewed the componetents that arrived and delegated soldering responsibilities. I suggested three possible feature improvements including a graph to visiaualize BAC levels over time, adding an RFID Tag to the PI to avoid tediously typing a number, and redesigning the PCB to allow for larger resistors and capacitors. 




# Date: March 8th 
Eshrith and I decided to take on a challenging task - soldering surface-mount components. We both had some experience with soldering but never had the opportunity to work with these tiny electronic components before. We gathered all the necessary tools, including a soldering iron, soldering wire, tweezers, and a magnifying glass to get a better view of the components. We spent hours practicing our technique and trying to perfect the delicate art of soldering surface-mount components. Despite encountering some difficulties, we persevered and eventually made significant progress.

# Date: March14th
I participated in a meeting to discuss a design document for an innovative project we were working on. The conversation revolved around the potential limitations of our current design, focusing primarily on the integration of a pressure sensor and parallel data streams. We brainstormed and exchanged ideas on how to address these issues while optimizing the overall performance of our device. It was an enlightening and inspiring discussion that provided valuable insights for our project's future development.





# Date: March 20th:
On March 20th, we hosted the first of two parties designed to gather training data for our project. We invited ten friends over to participate, ensuring that they were aware of the purpose of the gathering. As the participants consumed alcohol, we had them blow into our Arduino-based sensor and a commercial breathalyzer. This allowed us to collect valuable data to refine our device and algorithms.

# Date: March 21st:
During our meeting on March 21st, we delved deeper into the topic of making the pressure sensor work effectively. Several ideas were proposed, including placing a cloth in front of the breathalyzer, creating an enclosure to detect differences in pressure, and covering the pressure sensor with paper to observe changes. We also discussed the possibility of determining if someone was breathing through the breathalyzer by analyzing the fluctuations in the MQ-3 sensor values. The discussion was productive and led to a deeper understanding of the pressure sensor and its potential applications.



# Date: March 22nd:

Two days later, on March 22nd, we hosted a second party, this time focusing on collecting testing data. Once again, ten friends attended and drank alcohol. We repeated the process of having them blow into our Arduino sensor and a breathalyzer. The data gathered from this event would prove crucial in assessing the accuracy and reliability of our device.

# Date: March 23rd - 25th:
From March 23rd to 25th, Eshrith and I took on the task of soldering the second version of our PCB (printed circuit board). Despite their best efforts, they faced numerous challenges in achieving the precision and accuracy required to solder the intricate components of the PCB. This experience emphasized the importance of refining our soldering skills and investing in better equipment.

# Date: March 28th:
On the 28th of March, we had a brief meeting to discuss the difficulties encountered during our PCB soldering attempts. We shared tips and tricks, and brainstormed potential solutions to improve our soldering process. Although the discussion was short, it served as a reminder of the importance of communication and collaboration in overcoming obstacles and achieving our goals.
