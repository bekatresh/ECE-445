# Date: January 29
For the TipsyTracker Project Proposal, our group worked together closely to develop the block diagram that included the RFID subsystem, Breathalyzer measurement subsystem, and Data management subsystem. We had multiple brainstorming sessions where we shared our ideas, discussed the feasibility of different approaches, and evaluated the pros and cons of each subsystem.

We all shared our expertise and worked together to ensure that the different subsystems complemented each other and functioned effectively in the overall system. Each team member had a specific role to play, and we ensured that everyone had a clear understanding of their responsibilities.
