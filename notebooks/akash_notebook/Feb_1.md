Our group identified the problem of irresponsible drinking, which is a common issue, especially among university students, that leads to significant negative consequences, including deaths caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Our solution, TipsyTracker, is a comprehensive system that employs RFID-enabled wristbands/cards, breathalyzer devices, a Raspberry Pi server, and an ESP32 microcontroller to measure the blood alcohol content (BAC) levels of partygoers/patrons and encourage responsible drinking habits. TipsyTracker notifies guests about their BAC levels and sends reminders to them to check their levels, as well as alerts the host if a guest's BAC level exceeds a predetermined limit.

I specifically worked on identifying two subsystems. The Breathalyzer Measurement Subsystem, which involves the MQ-3 sensor, is responsible for measuring the BAC levels of partygoers/patrons by using a breathalyzer device. It is connected to the ESP32 microcontroller and communicates with the RFID identification subsystem to ensure that the test results are associated with the correct partygoer/patron. The Data Management Subsystem, powered by the Raspberry Pi server, is responsible for handling the communication between the device and the registration station and sending notifications to partygoers/patrons and the host. It hosts the necessary software and databases, handles data storage, analysis, and management, and sends reminders to partygoers/patrons at set intervals to test their BAC levels and notifies the host if necessary.

By working together as a group and collaborating effectively, we were able to develop a comprehensive solution that addresses the issue of excessive alcohol consumption and encourages responsible drinking habits. The TipsyTracker system is an effective solution to promote awareness and responsibility among partygoers and patrons.
