#February 7

On February 7th, the TipsyTracker development team made significant progress by successfully breadboarding the entire system design. This was a crucial step in the development process as it enabled us to test the functionality of the different subsystems and identify any potential issues that needed to be addressed before moving forward with the manufacturing process.

Breadboarding the entire system also allowed the team to ensure that all components were properly connected and that the system was functioning as expected. By leveraging the expertise of each team member, we were able to address any issues that arose during testing and ensure that the system was operating as intended.
