During the development of the TipsyTracker project proposal, I assisted the group by editing and refining the document to ensure that it was clear, concise, and well-organized. I worked closely with the team members to ensure that the document was coherent and that the language used was appropriate for the intended audience.

In addition to editing the proposal, I also drew a visual aid to help illustrate the system architecture and explain how the different subsystems interacted with each other. The visual aid helped to clarify the system design and made it easier for team members to understand the overall concept of the TipsyTracker system
