I am pleased to report that during the development of the TipsyTracker system, I was able to make significant progress on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematic. Specifically, I was able to complete the first schematic for the PCB, which included important components such as the power input, 5V to 3.3V regulator, USB-to-UART converter, MQ-3 sensor, RFID sensors, and other key parts.

The power input section of the schematic was critical to ensure that the device was able to operate properly and that there were no issues with power delivery. The 5V to 3.3V regulator was important to provide the correct voltage for the components, and the USB-to-UART converter enabled the device to communicate with the Raspberry Pi server.

The MQ-3 sensor and RFID sensors were also critical components that allowed the system to measure BAC levels and identify partygoers/patrons accurately. Other parts, such as capacitors and resistors, were included to ensure proper signal conditioning and noise reduction.

Overall, the completion of the first schematic for the PCB was a significant milestone in the development of the TipsyTracker system. By leveraging my skills in PCB design and component selection, I was able to ensure that the system was well-designed and capable of meeting the requirements of the project.
